‚úÖ Step 1: Focus on the Ingredients List
This is where harmful additives or unhealthy substances are usually hidden.

Watch Out For These Red Flags (‚ö†Ô∏è Potentially Harmful):


Ingredient	Risk
Sugar / High-Fructose Corn Syrup	Increases risk of diabetes, obesity
Trans Fats / Hydrogenated Oils	Raises bad cholesterol (LDL)
Sodium Nitrite / Sodium Nitrate	Linked to high blood pressure, cancer risk
Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)	Can cause headaches, high sodium intake
Artificial Colors (e.g., Red 40, Yellow 5)	Linked to hyperactivity, allergies
Palm Oil	High in saturated fats (raises cholesterol)
‚úÖ Good Ingredients:


Ingredient	Benefit
Whole Grains (oats, brown rice)	Heart health, fiber-rich
Fiber / Dietary Fiber	Supports digestion
Nuts & Seeds	Healthy fats, protein
Natural Sweeteners (honey, jaggery)	Better than refined sugar
Spices (turmeric, ginger)	Anti-inflammatory
‚úÖ Step 2: Read the Nutritional Facts Table
Look for these indicators:


Label Component	Good Range	Bad Range
Total Fat	< 3g per 100g (low-fat)	> 17g per 100g
Saturated Fat	< 1.5g per 100g	> 5g per 100g
Sodium (Salt)	< 120mg per 100g	> 400mg per 100g
Sugars	< 5g per 100g	> 22g per 100g
Fiber	> 3g per 100g	< 1g per 100g
‚úÖ Step 3: Look for Certification Logos
‚úÖ FSSAI, USDA Organic, India Organic ‚Äì Trusted quality and safety

‚ùå Avoid if ‚ÄúNo certification‚Äù is shown on processed foods

‚úÖ Step 4: Use Ingredient/Health Awareness Tools
For automated analysis (like in your app), you can use:

Open Food Facts

USDA FoodData Central

Nutrition Rating Systems: Nutri-Score, Health Star Rating

‚úÖ Step 5: Bonus - Mobile Apps for Awareness (Optional Inspiration)
Apps that do what you want to build:

Yuka ‚Äì Scans product barcodes and highlights risks

MyFitnessPal ‚Äì Shows health impact per serving

Open Food Facts ‚Äì Community-powered database

üíª For Your App: Use Logic Like This
